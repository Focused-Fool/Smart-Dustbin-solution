# Smart IoT Dustbin - Team Matrix

## Project Overview
The Smart IoT Dustbin project, created by Team Matrix, addresses urban waste management with an automated, efficient approach. Our dustbin features sensors for automatic lid opening, fullness detection, and alert notifications to local authorities, ensuring timely disposal and minimal manual intervention. Future upgrades include solar power and Wi-Fi integration for enhanced sustainability.

## Features
- **Automatic Lid Operation**: Opens automatically when approached to contain odors and reduce contact.
- **Fullness Detection**: Senses when the bin is full and initiates a notification.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends alerts via Wi-Fi for prompt disposal.
- **Sustainable Power**: Supports solar power for eco-friendly operation.
- **Scalable Design**: Adaptable to multiple bins, ideal for public and high-traffic areas.

## Components
- **Servo Motor**: Precisely controls the lid.
- **IR or Load Sensor**: Monitors the bin’s fill level.
- **Wi-Fi Module**: Enables connectivity for alerts.
- **Microcontroller**: Manages sensor and motor operations.

## How It Works
1. **Detection**: The motion sensor triggers the lid to open when someone approaches.
2. **Fill Level Monitoring**: The IR or load sensor monitors the bin’s capacity.
3. **Alert System**: When full, a notification is sent via Wi-Fi.
4. **Power Management**: Future versions will integrate solar power for sustainable energy.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE or a similar programming environment
- Required hardware components as listed above

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Focused-Fool/Smart-Dustbin-solution.git
2. Connect components according to the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the code from the src folder to the microcontroller.
4. Configure sensor settings in the code.

## Usage
1. Place the bin in a open area.
2. Monitor fullness notifications to ensure timely disposal.

## Future Improvements

1. Network support for multiple bins
2. Solar power integration
3. Advanced data reporting via a web or mobile interface
