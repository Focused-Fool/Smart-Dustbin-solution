Smart IoT Dustbin - Team Matrix


Project Overview


This Smart IoT Dustbin project is developed by Team Matrix to address urban waste management challenges with cleaner more
efficient approach. Our dustbin is equipped with sensors for automatic lid opening, fullness detection, and alert to
the local authorities ensure that there's minimal human input in the disposal process and that it happens in time. 
Future improvements include the introduction of solar power and Wi-Fi connectivity for greater efficiency and sustainability.


Features:


Automatic Lid Operation: The lid opens automatically when a person approaches, reducing contact and containing foul odors.
Fullness Detection: Sensors detect when the bin is full and automatically send a notification for waste disposal.
Real-Time Alerts: Alerts are sent via Red LED to the nearest Vehicle or authority for prompt cleanup.
Sustainable Power Options: Designed to support solar power, making the bin energy-efficient and eco-friendly.
Scalability: Can be implemented for multiple bins at once, ideal for public spaces or large facilities.


Components:


Servo Motor: Controls the lid movement with precision.
IR or Load Sensor: Detects when the bin is full.
Wi-Fi Module: Enables connectivity to send fullness alerts.
Microcontroller: Manages sensor data and controls motor actions.


How It Works:


Detection: When someone approaches, the motion sensor triggers, and the lid opens automatically.
Fill Level Monitoring: The Ultra Sonic constantly monitors the bin's fill level.
Alert System: Upon reaching full capacity, the system sends an alert to the designated local authorities through glowing red led.
Power Management: Future versions will integrate solar power to run sustainably.


Getting Started:


Prerequisites:


Arduino IDE (or preferred programming environment)
Necessary hardware components as listed above


Setup:


Connect the components as per the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
Upload the code from the src folder to the microcontroller.


Usage:


Place the dustbin in a location with Wi-Fi connectivity.
Monitor the fullness notifications to ensure timely emptying of the bin.


Future Improvements:

Support for managing multiple bins in a network
Integration of solar power options
Enhanced data reporting via a web or mobile app interface
